# LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my **LeetCode Solutions** repository! ðŸŽ‰

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems, implemented in multiple programming languages. It serves as my personal coding journal, showcasing my growth and the techniques I've explored while tackling algorithmic challenges.

## Highlights
- Solutions are written in languages such as **Python**, **Java**, **C#**, and more.
- Each solution is designed to be **efficient** and **well-documented**, providing clarity on problem-solving approaches.

## Tools and Workflow
I'm using the [@3ba2ii extension](https://github.com/LeetSync/LeetSync) in my browser to seamlessly integrate LeetCode problems into my codebase. This powerful tool simplifies managing, organizing, and syncing solutions directly with LeetCode challenges.

## Future Plans
I'm excited to expand this project by creating **YouTube videos** on the following topics inspired by my LeetCode learning journey. Below is a to do list for me for topics I want to make vidoes on:

- Function Composition and reduceRight
  

## Contribution and Feedback
This is a learning-focused repository, and I'm always looking for feedback to improve my solutions. If you spot an optimization or have suggestions, feel free to open an issue.
